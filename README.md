# Daily Post Generator

Pick a technology topic, and this finds one noteworthy recent item on it and
drafts two social posts from that same source: a short one for X and a longer,
opinionated one for LinkedIn. By default it runs on Groq's free tier, where one
call both searches the web and writes the posts. Anthropic's Claude, or any
OpenAI-compatible endpoint, can be swapped in with a flag, and RSS feeds you
choose can replace the web search.

Human-in-the-loop by default. Nothing is published unless you ask for it.

The posts sound like *you* because of a profile file you write once and keep
outside this repo. That file is the whole idea: the code is a small harness,
and the profile is where the topics, the voice, the point of view, and the
guardrails live.

## How it works

Each run:

1. Asks which topic to cover — a numbered menu from your profile's `## Topics`
   section, or a built-in catalog of common IT areas. `--topic` skips the
   prompt, `--random-topic` rolls the dice.
2. Searches the web for a substantive recent item in that area, filtered by
   your **beat**: what counts as a good find, what to exclude, who it is for.
   With `--search rss` it chooses from your feeds' newest entries instead.
3. Skips anything already used, by URL or by title, tracked in `history.json`.
4. Writes two posts from that one source. The X version reports; the LinkedIn
   version argues — it takes a position, says what the item does not solve,
   and ends with a question worth answering.
5. Prints both drafts and appends them to `drafts.md` with the topic, source,
   and a one-line rationale for the pick.
6. Logs the outcome, success or failure, to `run.log`.

## Requirements

- Python 3.14 or newer
- A free Groq API key — https://console.groq.com/keys
- Nothing else for the default setup: the `groq` and `openai-compat` providers
  use only the standard library. `--provider anthropic` needs the `anthropic`
  extra, pinned in `pyproject.toml`; see [Optional extras](#optional-extras).
  `--post` needs tweepy, installed by hand (see
  [Optional: publishing to X](#optional-publishing-to-x)).

## Setup

There are two ways to run it:

- **Installed, as the `xgp` command.** Installing from a tagged release, with
  `uv tool install` or `pipx`, is documented when releases start (v3.1 PR 4).
  Once installed, `xgp init` creates your data directory and a profile to fill
  in, and `xgp` takes the same flags as `daily_post.py` below.
- **From a clone of this repo**, with `python daily_post.py`. The steps below
  cover this path; every command works the same as `xgp`.

**1. Virtual environment.** Required on Homebrew and modern-distro Pythons,
which block system-wide pip installs per PEP 668. Nothing needs installing for
the default provider:

```bash
python3 -m venv ~/.ai_post_venv
# only if you will use --provider anthropic, run from the clone:
~/.ai_post_venv/bin/pip install -e '.[anthropic]'
```

**2. API key**, in a protected file outside the repo:

```bash
echo 'export GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_your-full-key' >> ~/.ai_post_env
chmod 600 ~/.ai_post_env
```

Use `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` instead (from https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys)
if you run `--provider anthropic`.

The script loads this at startup. An already-set environment variable wins,
which is handy for one-off overrides. The `export` prefix is optional but lets
the same file double as a shell-sourceable env file.

**3. Author profile — the important step.** Create it from the scaffold, then
fill it in:

```bash
~/.ai_post_venv/bin/python daily_post.py init    # installed: xgp init
```

This creates the data directory (`~/XPosts`, or `AI_POST_DATA_DIR`) with mode
700 if it doesn't exist, and copies `xgenerateposts/author_profile.example.md`
there as `author_profile.md`, with mode 600. It never overwrites an existing
profile: if one is there, it says so and exits without changing anything.

The scaffold explains each section:

| Section | What it does |
|---|---|
| `## Topics` | Your run-time menu of technology areas. Omit it to use the built-in catalog |
| `## Beat` | What makes an item worth posting *whatever* the topic: quality bar, exclusions, audience |
| `## Voice` | How you think and sound — your actual positions, plus real sentences you wrote |
| `## Experience` | Things you have really done that posts may reference, with a guardrail capping it at one per post |
| `## Never` | Hard rules: no employer names, no invented hands-on claims, whatever would misrepresent you |
| `## Hashtags` | A pool to draw from |
| `## Feeds` | RSS or Atom feed URLs, one per line. Used only with `--search rss` |

Beat and Voice are required. Spend your time on **Voice** — and especially on
pasting a handful of sentences you actually wrote. A description of your tone
produces competent generic prose; real samples give the model a cadence to
imitate. **Never** is what keeps a model trying to sound expert from inventing
credentials on your behalf.

Keep this file out of version control — it is personal, and it is already in
`.gitignore`.

## Optional extras

The Anthropic SDK for `--provider anthropic` is an optional extra, `anthropic`,
so the default install stays standard library only. Its exact version is pinned
in `pyproject.toml`. Install it from the repo clone, the route matching how you
run it:

```bash
# Installed xgp command:
uv tool install --reinstall '.[anthropic]'
# A repo clone's virtual environment:
~/.ai_post_venv/bin/pip install -e '.[anthropic]'
```

`uv tool install --reinstall` replaces the whole tool environment, so a later
`uv tool install --reinstall .` without the extra drops it. In the venv, `-e`
links the install to this clone: `daily_post.py` and the venv both use the
clone's code, so a `git pull` needs no reinstall unless the pin in
`pyproject.toml` changes.

tweepy, for `--post`, isn't an extra yet: tweepy 4.17.0 requires oauthlib
below 4, and oauthlib 3.3.1 has open advisories fixed only in 4.0.0
(`docs/decisions.md`). Install it by hand in a clone's venv; see
[Optional: publishing to X](#optional-publishing-to-x).

## Usage

```bash
~/.ai_post_venv/bin/python daily_post.py
```

You get a topic menu, then both drafts print to the terminal and land in
`~/XPosts/drafts.md`. Review, edit, post them yourself. Run whenever you like —
dedup makes irregular timing safe, and a second run the same day simply picks a
different item.

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| *(none)* | Interactive topic menu, then draft both posts. The default |
| `--topic X` | Menu number, part of a menu entry, or free text not in the menu at all |
| `--random-topic` | Pick from the menu at random |
| `--list-topics` | Show the menu and exit |
| `--history` | Show the last 10 items used, with their topics |
| `--profile PATH` | Use a different profile file — handy for running more than one persona |
| `--provider NAME` | `groq`, `anthropic` or `openai-compat`. Default: `AI_POST_PROVIDER`, else `groq` |
| `--search SOURCE` | `native` or `rss`. Default: `AI_POST_SEARCH`, else `native` for `groq` and `anthropic`, `rss` for `openai-compat` |
| `--post` | Publish the X version (see below) |
| `--post-linkedin` | Publish the LinkedIn version (see below) |

For a shorter daily command, keep a wrapper outside the repo, e.g.
`~/XPosts/aipost.sh`:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail
exec "$HOME/.ai_post_venv/bin/python" "/path/to/daily_post.py" "$@"
```

`chmod +x` it once, then each day is `~/XPosts/aipost.sh` — and arguments pass
straight through, so `~/XPosts/aipost.sh --topic kubernetes` works too.

### Providers and search

| Provider | Model | Native search | Credential |
|---|---|---|---|
| `groq` (default) | `openai/gpt-oss-120b`, or `GROQ_MODEL` | Groq's `browser_search` tool | `GROQ_API_KEY` |
| `anthropic` | `claude-sonnet-4-6` | Anthropic's `web_search` tool | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` |
| `openai-compat` | `OPENAI_COMPAT_MODEL` | None; uses `--search rss` | `OPENAI_COMPAT_API_KEY`, if the service needs one |

`openai-compat` reaches Gemini, Cerebras or a local Ollama server with no code
change: set `OPENAI_COMPAT_BASE_URL` to the endpoint up to `/v1` (https only;
plain http is allowed for `localhost`) and `OPENAI_COMPAT_MODEL` to its model
name. A missing credential stops the run with the variable to set; the script
never falls back to another provider.

With `--search rss`, the script reads the feeds in your profile's `## Feeds`
section and the model chooses from their newest entries, without searching the
web. Feed text is passed to the model as clearly marked data, never as
instructions. Feeds must be `https://`; a feed that redirects to plain `http://`,
fails, or isn't valid RSS or Atom is logged to `run.log` and skipped, and the
run fails only if no feed has a new entry. RSS needs Python's Expat XML library
at 2.7.2 or newer, which current Python releases include; the script checks
and exits with both versions if it isn't.

**Groq free plan.** Whether the free plan allows `browser_search`, and whether
one search call fits its tokens-per-minute limit, is not published. If a
`--provider groq` run is refused or rate limited, run
`--provider groq --search rss` instead: Groq then only writes the posts, from
your feeds.

Environment variables (set them in `~/.ai_post_env` or the shell; a value already set in
the shell wins, and `AI_POST_ENV_FILE` works only from the shell):

| Variable | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `AI_POST_PROVIDER` | `groq` | Provider when `--provider` isn't given |
| `AI_POST_SEARCH` | `native` for `groq` and `anthropic`, `rss` for `openai-compat` | Search source when `--search` isn't given |
| `GROQ_API_KEY` | none | Groq key, from https://console.groq.com/keys |
| `GROQ_MODEL` | `openai/gpt-oss-120b` | Groq model |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | none | Anthropic key, for `--provider anthropic` |
| `OPENAI_COMPAT_BASE_URL` | none | Endpoint up to `/v1`, for `--provider openai-compat` |
| `OPENAI_COMPAT_MODEL` | none | Model name, for `--provider openai-compat` |
| `OPENAI_COMPAT_API_KEY` | none | Key for that service; not needed for local Ollama |
| `AI_POST_PROVIDER_TIMEOUT` | `120` | Seconds to wait for a response. Applies to `groq` and `openai-compat` only; `anthropic` keeps its SDK's own timeout. Feed requests always time out after 15 seconds |
| `AI_POST_RSS_PER_FEED` | `3` | Newest entries taken from each feed with `--search rss` |
| `AI_POST_RSS_MAX_ENTRIES` | `20` | Most candidates sent to the model with `--search rss`, after the per-feed cap. Entries matching more of the topic's words go first, then newer ones. Lower it if Groq returns 413 |
| `AI_POST_DATA_DIR` | `~/XPosts` | Where the profile, drafts, history and run log live |
| `AI_POST_ENV_FILE` | `~/.ai_post_env` | The key file loaded at startup. Read from the shell environment only: the file can't name its own location, so setting it inside the file has no effect |

### Optional: publishing to X

```bash
~/.ai_post_venv/bin/pip install tweepy
~/.ai_post_venv/bin/python daily_post.py --post
```

Needs an X developer app set to **Read and Write** and four user-context
credentials in `~/.ai_post_env`. A Bearer token alone is app-only auth and
cannot post:

```bash
export X_API_KEY=...
export X_API_SECRET=...
export X_ACCESS_TOKEN=...
export X_ACCESS_SECRET=...
```

### Optional: publishing to LinkedIn

Included for anyone who wants it; the author of this repo drafts and posts
LinkedIn manually. Requires an approved LinkedIn app with the
`w_member_social` scope, a member access token, and your author URN:

```bash
export LINKEDIN_ACCESS_TOKEN=...
export LINKEDIN_AUTHOR_URN=urn:li:person:XXXXXXXX
# optional; LinkedIn revises this periodically
export LINKEDIN_API_VERSION=202601
```

LinkedIn's app review is meaningfully more involved than X's, and it changes
its API version header on a schedule. If `--post-linkedin` returns a 4xx,
check the current version header first.

### Optional: scheduling

Unattended runs need a topic, since there is no terminal to ask on — the script
says so rather than hanging:

```cron
0 8 * * * $HOME/.ai_post_venv/bin/python /path/to/daily_post.py --random-topic >> $HOME/XPosts/cron.log 2>&1
```

Env-file loading means no key handling in the crontab. On laptops that sleep,
`anacron` (Linux) or `launchd` (macOS) give "run once a day whenever awake"
semantics instead.

## Files

In the repo:

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `daily_post.py` | Runs the generator from a clone; a few lines that call the package |
| `xgenerateposts/` | The generator, as a package. Installed, it provides the `xgp` command |
| `xgenerateposts/author_profile.example.md` | Scaffold that `xgp init` copies; fill it in |
| `scripts/install-check.sh` | Builds and installs the package in a clean environment and checks `xgp init` (`make install-check`) |
| `tests/` | Unit and acceptance tests, run with `make check`; no network needed |
| `docs/decisions.md` | Owner decisions and recorded departures |

In your data directory (`~/XPosts` by default, override with
`AI_POST_DATA_DIR`):

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `author_profile.md` | Your topics and voice. You write this; the script only reads it |
| `drafts.md` | Every draft generated, with date, topic, title, rationale, and the provider and search source used |
| `history.json` | URLs and titles already used — dedup across runs — with the provider, model and search source of each |
| `run.log` | One timestamped line per run, ending with the provider and search source |

## Development

The dev tools (pytest, pytest-cov, ruff, mypy, pip-audit) are pinned in
`uv.lock`; the script itself still needs nothing beyond the standard library.
With [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) installed:

```bash
uv sync      # Python from .python-version, plus the dev tools from uv.lock
make check   # ruff check, ruff format --check, mypy, pytest with coverage
make audit   # pip-audit against the locked dependencies
make sbom    # CycloneDX SBOM of the runtime dependencies, to build/sbom.cdx.json
make install-check  # build, install into a clean venv, check xgp --help and xgp init
```

### Security checks

Every pull request to master runs three more checks (`.github/workflows/security.yml`):
`gitleaks` scans the git history for secrets, `semgrep` runs the `p/default`
rules, and `pip-audit` runs `make audit`. gitleaks and Semgrep findings also
appear in the repo's Security tab. `pip-audit (daily)` runs the same audit on
master every day, so an advisory against a locked version shows up between
pull requests. Dependabot proposes weekly updates for `uv.lock` and the
pinned actions.

`.claude/settings.json` holds the agent rules for Claude Code: it denies
merges, force-pushes, amends, rebases, tags and edits to the frozen tests,
and asks before every push, `gh pr` and `gh api` call. Only Dusten edits it.

Each push to master uploads the SBOM as a workflow artifact named
`sbom-<commit SHA>` (`.github/workflows/sbom.yml`, kept 90 days); download it
from that run on the Actions tab.

## Design notes

**Why the topic is chosen per run rather than fixed.** A single hardcoded
subject produces a monotonous feed and burns through the good material in that
niche fast. Picking per run lets one profile cover a whole professional range,
and `--random-topic` keeps it varied without a decision every morning.

**Why a profile file instead of constants in the script.** Voice, guardrails,
topics, and beat are the parts that differ per person and change most often.
Keeping them in plain text means you can edit your voice without touching code,
run several personas off one script with `--profile`, and share the code
without sharing anything personal.

**Why LinkedIn drafts are flagged rather than truncated.** X posts are
hard-trimmed at a sentence boundary because the platform enforces the limit
anyway. A LinkedIn post trimmed from the end loses its closing question and
hashtags — the two things you least want to lose — so an overlong draft prints
a warning and its character count, and you shorten it during review.

**Why the experience guardrail is worded so bluntly.** A model asked to write
as an experienced practitioner will produce plausible-sounding credentials it
was never given. Capping references at one per post and forbidding anything
outside the list is what keeps the output honest — and it matters more once
topics vary, since some days will land outside your deepest expertise.

## Security notes

- API keys live in a `chmod 600` file in your home directory, never in the
  repo. `.gitignore` also excludes `.ai_post_env`, `*.env`, your profile, and
  all generated output. Error messages name the variable, never its value.
- Before any public push: `grep -riE "sk-ant|gsk_" .` should return nothing
  except placeholders: the examples in this README and the script, and the
  fake sentinel key in `tests/conftest.py`.
- Web pages and feed entries can contain text aimed at the model. Drafts are
  never published unless you pass `--post` or `--post-linkedin`, so read each
  one before posting.
- If a key is ever committed, deleting it later does not scrub git history —
  rotate the key.
