X/Twitter post rules:
- Under {max_len} characters excluding the URL (the URL is appended separately).
- Lead with what the item actually does and why the audience should care.
- One clear takeaway. Plain, confident voice. No hype words
  ("game-changer", "mind-blowing", "insane").
- 2-3 hashtags.
""".strip()

LINKEDIN_RULES = """
LinkedIn post rules:
- Target 750-950 characters INCLUDING the closing question and hashtags.
  {max_len} is a hard ceiling. Under budget beats trimmed.
- Short paragraphs, blank line between each. No markdown, no bold, no
  headers, no bullet characters — LinkedIn renders none of them.
- Open with a hook of one or two lines that earns the click on "see more":
  a specific claim, a sharp observation, a real tension, or a question with
  actual stakes. Attention must come from SUBSTANCE, not engagement bait.
  Banned openers: "Let that sink in.", "Here's the thing.", "Unpopular
  opinion:", "I'll say it.", and anything followed by a one-word paragraph
  for drama.
- Spend AT MOST one sentence describing the item; the link carries the
  details. The bulk of the post is the author's position and the takeaway.
- Take a real position: what this signals, where it will work, where it will
  fall over, what it does not solve, what must be true operationally for it
  to deliver.
- Then the value: what a practitioner or leader should DO with this — a
  question to ask a vendor, a place to pilot it, a prerequisite to fix
  first, a reason to wait.
- Close with a question that invites expert replies, not applause.
- End with 3-5 hashtags on their own line.
- Never disparage a named company. Critique the pattern, not the vendor.

Pick exactly ONE item — the most substantive and interesting to the audience

plain text — quotes, apostrophes, and line breaks are all fine and need no
escaping.
